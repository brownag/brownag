### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrew Brown. I am a soil scientist with an interest in open-source software.

Most of my software development work centers around interoperability, R-based tools, National Cooperative Soil Survey databases and data sources, and spatial data analysis. I am fortunate to be able to do some of this work as part of my work as a soil scientist.

I have a blog that I rarely add posts to these days: http://humus.rocks

I maintain several R packages; several of which are available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) and the ncss-tech r-universe repository (https://ncss-tech.r-universe.dev/ui#packages)
